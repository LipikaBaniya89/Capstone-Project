# Capstone-Project

## Project Overview
An analysis of the impact of exchange rates, inflation, and FDI on trade balances across income groups using the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators dataset. The study applies multiple linear regression on data from 22 countries across three income categories to test key economic hypotheses.

## Dataset Information
- **Data source** : World Development Indicators - World Bank (https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators)
- **Country selection criteria**: Selected from three income categories, which were already pre-categorized by the World Bank as lower-middle-income countries, upper-middle-income countries, and high-income countries
- **Variables used**</br>
**Dependent**:
   - Trade Balance
**Independent**:</br>
    - Exchange Rate
    - FDI Net-inflow
    - FDI Net-outflow
    - Inflation

## Medthodology
- **Statistical model**: Multiple Linear Regression
- **Hypotheses tested**
  > Hypothesis (H1): The exchange rate has a significant impact on lower and middle-income countries.</br>
  > Hypothesis (H2): Inflation negatively affects the trade balance in lower, middle and high-income countries.</br>
  > Hypothesis (H3): FDI inflows and outflows have a positive impact on the trade balance of high-income, low- and middle-income countries.</br>
- **Tools/libraries** : R ((ggplot2, dplyr, caret, rpart, car)
